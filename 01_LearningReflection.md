## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- 
     It was quite interesting. Very basic, but at this level of knowledge it is enough to get a glimpse about what testing is like.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
-  I followed the instructions from the video and from the template and wrote what I have done and what message I have seen.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -     
Editing the codes?

The process went smoothly.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-
 

      I have used it for other assignments. Yet I am not too familiar with it. Let's see how the upload will go :)

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- 
Not really familiar in details to be able to choose, but maybe in the future.


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

Proficiency in manual testing methodologies and techniques
Experience with automated testing tools (Selenium, Wireshark, Minitest, CoPilot, Cypress, Jest, or similar)
Knowledge of programming languages (Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Typescript)
Familiarity with version control systems (Git)

All of these, but I am mostly focused on learning coding (Python, JavaScript, C++, C#, Java). I need to learn about automated testing tools and Scrum/Agile environments.



## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-It is very basic, but at this point it gives a good overview. I would be interested to gain more knowledge and learn to use above mentioned automated testing tools.
